![Dashboard Overview](Assets/Project1_Dashboard_Overview.gif)

## Overview
This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze trends in the global data job market using real-world 2024 job posting data. The project was built to strengthen hands-on Power BI skills by working through the complete business intelligence lifecycle—from data preparation to insight-driven visualization.

The dashboard consolidates fragmented job market information such as job titles, salaries, locations, and hiring platforms into a single, intuitive interface. It enables users to explore market demand, compensation patterns, and geographic distribution through dynamic filters and drill-through analysis.

## Project Objective

- Translate raw job posting data into actionable insights
- Demonstrate practical Power BI capabilities used in real analytics roles
- Build an interactive report that supports exploration, comparison, and decision-making

## Data Set 

- Global data-related job postings (2024)
- Includes job titles, salary information, locations, work mode, and hiring platforms

## Skills Showcased

This project was a journey through key Power BI features. Here's a look at what we mastered:

-   **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.
-   **📊 Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time.
-   **🗺️ Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of jobs.
-   **🔢 KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **🖱️ Interactive Reporting:**
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.
