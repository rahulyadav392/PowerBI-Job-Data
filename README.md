![Dashboard Overview](Assets/Project1_Dashboard_Overview.gif)

## Overview
This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze trends in the global data job market using job posting data scrapped through various job portals in 2024. The project was built to strengthen hands on Power BI skills by working through the complete business intelligence lifecycle, i.e from data preparation to driving ingights via visualization.

The dashboard consolidates fragmented job market information such as job titles, salaries, locations, and hiring platforms into a single, intuitive interface. It enables users to explore market demand, compensation patterns, and geographic distribution through dynamic filters and using PowerBI's drill-through feature for deeper analysis.

## Project Objective

- Translate raw job posting data into actionable insights
- Demonstrate practical Power BI capabilities used in real analytics roles
- Build an interactive report that supports exploration, comparison, and decision making

## Data Set 

- Global data related job postings (2024)
- Includes job titles, salary information, locations, work mode, and hiring platforms

## Skills Showcased

This project was a journey through key Power BI features. Here's a look at what we mastered:

-   **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.
-   **📊 Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time.
-   **🗺️ Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of jobs.
-   **🔢 KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **🖱️ Interactive Reporting:**
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.
